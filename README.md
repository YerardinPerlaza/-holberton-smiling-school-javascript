# Holberton Smiling School
In this project, we will finalize the previous project 0x0B. Implement a design with bootstrap and make some parts dynamic with Javascript (JQuery exactly).

We will reuse final files of 0x0B. Implement a design with bootstrap and update them.

We will use all HTML/CSS/Accessibility/Responsive design/Bootstrap/Javascript knowledges that you learned previously.

We are free to implement it the way that you want - the objective is simple: Have fully functional web pages that look the same as the designer file.
